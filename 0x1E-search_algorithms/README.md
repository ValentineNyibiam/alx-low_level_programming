# Overview #

The ** 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms ** is a project that focuses on,
helping to solidify knowledge on data structures and how to use them
effectively in our programs.
The concept of search algorithms in one the is essential for evry software
engineer, search algorithms are step by step processes which are followed
in order to identify an element in a collection of data. When working
with data as a SE the concept is essential to help acheive code 
effeciency and curtail code redundancy.
